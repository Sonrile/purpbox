Anyways, if you want this it's purple gruvbox because I saw this https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/13nkf2z/oc_openbsd_autorice_script_in_perl/ and went, "yes please"


It looks like this:

If you want to know how i riced my arch linux chromebook like this, i used ![this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX_gQTQLUZc)
tutorial and then edited the window decoration's in /user/**your_user**/.local/share/aurorae/themes to be the same purple as my terminal. Then I downloaded the kvantum and kde plasma color theme Win12OS-Nord and used that... I just have purple macos now lmao.
