(((THIS IS JUST A REMIX OF GRUVBOX; I ONLY UPLOADED THIS TO GITHUB SO THAT I COULD DOWNLOAD IT TO MULTIPLE MACHINES)))

go to github.com/morhetz/gruvbox for the real version haha

Anyways, if you want this it's purple gruvbox because I saw this https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/13nkf2z/oc_openbsd_autorice_script_in_perl/ and went, "yes please"


Dark mode looks like this:

![purple gruvbox](https://github.com/Sonrile/purpbox/assets/122113812/88d35463-4a2c-4bc0-95ab-225f1b7ee0ca)
(Dark mode is set with :set bg=dark)

And light mode looks like this:

![light box](https://github.com/Sonrile/purpbox/assets/122113812/81d99c1c-3b71-4462-a038-9d3c4cdd1781)
I think it's fair to say that nobody will be downloading this for the light mode, but you can edit the colors to your
will easily by going to where your package manager downlaods this (for me its ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/purpbox/)
and just editing the hex values?

If you want to know how i riced my arch linux chromebook like this, i used ![this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX_gQTQLUZc)
tutorial and then edited the window decoration's in /user/**your_user**/.local/share/aurorae/themes to be the same purple as my terminal. Then I downloaded the kvantum and kde plasma color theme Win12OS-Nord and used that... I just have purple macos now lmao.
